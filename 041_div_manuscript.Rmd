We sequenced the bacterial communities in stool samples collected from five vaccine trial participants before and after exposure to pathogenic _E. coli_ (Fig. \@ref(fig:experimentalDesign)).  Mixture samples were generated by titrating pre- and post- exposure samples at different concentrations.  Each sample was sequenced twice at two different laboratories (JHU and NIST) for a total of four runs.
